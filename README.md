# 🌐 Full Stack Web Development Journey

Welcome to my **Web Development Training Repository** 🚀  
This repository documents my **learning journey, practice work, and mini-projects** as I build strong foundations in **Frontend and Backend Web Development**.

I am currently learning through the **Sigma Web Development Course** along with other trusted resources, and applying everything through hands-on coding.

This repo is a reflection of **consistent learning, experimentation, and improvement**.
